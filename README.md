# Encryption
 Data security and privacy have become
critical concerns in the era of digital
communication. Previous research demonstrates
that the LSB approach can be used when the
secret picture size is less than or equal to 80x80
and the maximum number of characters inserted
is 8192 characters. In this paper, a system called
"Securing data in image using Advanced
Encryption Standard" which leverages the AES
algorithm to securely hide any type of data
within images is proposed. The system aims to
provide a simple yet effective approach for
securely storing and transmitting sensitive data
in the form of images. The system utilizes the
AES algorithm, a symmetric encryption
algorithm known for its robustness and speed, to
encrypt data. The system supports hiding any
type of data, not limited to text, within images.
The paper discusses the implementation of AES
encryption and decryption, along with the
techniques used for data hiding in images.
